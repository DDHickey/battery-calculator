# battery-calculator
A python script that demonstrates simple OCR from tesseract in order to retrieve the battery percentage on a mac.

Plan of Action:
  * I intended to practice screen capture by programmatically taking a screenshot of my mac laptop in the desired region of battery percentage.
  * I used image processing skills to take the screen shot and make the text bigger and more clear by using terminal commands and ImageMagick.
  * Finally, I used tesseract to write the percentage to an external file and re-open to display the text.
  
  
   * PS. I wrote to an external text file only for practice and for potential other uses outside of the script.
   
   
   \* Also Note *
 This is not the most efficient manner of getting your computer battery percentage as for most computers there are API or alternative libraries
 that specialize in getting bettery percentages. I wanted to practice python ocr and I felt this was the most efficient manner. 
 Also, I plan on using opencv in the future for python ocr however this was my very first demonstration with python ocr and by no means the best way.
